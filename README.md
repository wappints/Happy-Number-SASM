# Happy Number SASM

Note: Run this through CLI or Command Prompt. 

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
A happy number are numbers whose sequences of squaring every digit of the given number then combine terms until its iteration ends at 1.  

For example, the given number is: 13 . 

Square the value of every digit then combine terms: 13 -> 1^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 9 = 10

Repeat the process with the new number: 10 -> 1^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 0 = 1 

The sequence repeats until it ends at 1. 

A constraint of 20 iterations was added to prevent infinite loops in order for it to determine that it is an unhappy number.
